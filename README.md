## Hi there 👋

I am a master student at the Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Section of [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/).

 - I'm very interested in computational chemistry, espically in _ab initio_ calculation, its speed-up methods and its application to biological systems.
 - I'm willing to learn machine learning techniques and apply it to my future researches on chemistry.
 - I'm currently in an internship of [QuanMol Tech](https://quanmol.com/).
 - I hold a honor bachelor degree of chemistry from Fudan University.
 - I love cooking🍳\!
