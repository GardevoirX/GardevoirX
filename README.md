## Hi there 👋

I am a master student at the Chemistry and Chemical Engineering Section of [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/).

 - I'm very interested in computational chemistry, especially in _ab initio_ calculation, its speed-up methods and its application to biological systems.
 - I'm willing to learn machine learning techniques and apply them to my future research on chemistry.
 - I'm currently in an internship at [QuanMol Tech](https://quanmol.com/).
 - I hold an honor bachelor degree in chemistry from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/).
 - I love cooking🍳\!
